# Practice Exam 6

Topics to review:

1. On start:
  * EC2-Classic -> Private IPv4 address
  * EC2-VPC -> Static IPv4 address (does not change)

2. Distribute requests to EC2s in multiple AZs -> Cross-zone load balancing

3. The recommended sotrage engine for MySQL is InnoDB and **not** MyISAM which is more heavy duty

4. Workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage -> Storage Optimized Instances

5. Lambda max execution duration per request -> 15 minutes
