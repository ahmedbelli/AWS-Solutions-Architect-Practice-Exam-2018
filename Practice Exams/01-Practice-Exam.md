# Practice Exam 1

Topics to review:

1. The EC2-Classic platform does not retain its associated Elastic IP addresses when the EBS-backed EC2 instance is stopped

2. Pre-built AMIs are not accessible to another region so you have to copy them to another region to properly establish disaster recovery

3. AWS DynamoDB Accelerator DAX that can reduce Amazon DynamoDB response times from milliseconds to microseconds, even at millions of requests per second

4. Transferring data from an EC2 instance to an S3 instance to an S3 bucket in the same region has no cost at all

5. If a company is using a corporate Active Directory, it is best to use AWS Directory Service AD Connector for easier integration. In addition, since the roles are already assigned using groups in the corporate Active Directory, it would be better to also use IAM Roles.
